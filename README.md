## How to use
- Add hook with `Alt`+`1`/`2`/`3`/`4`
- Remove hook with `Alt`+`Shift`+`1`/`2`/`3`/`4`
- Reset all hooks with `Alt`+`0`
- Close the overlay with `Alt`+`Esc`

Make sure your game is set to **Windowed Fullscreen**, otherwise the overlay may not be visible.

## Resolution & HUD scale
Works with all resolutions. If you're not using default **100%** HUD scale, you need to select your current scale in the tray menu.

## Is it safe?
**Yes!** This is just an overlay, no different than taking notes on a piece of paper.

## Antivirus
The app is unsigned, so your antivirus might view it as a threat.
